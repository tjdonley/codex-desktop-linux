# AGENTS.md

## Purpose

This repository repackages OpenAI's signed official Linux `chatgpt` package as
the independently named `codex-desktop` distribution. It preserves the
official ELF/Electron payload and bundled tools, adds disabled-by-default Linux
features, builds deb/RPM/pacman/AppImage/Nix outputs, and ships a Rust update
manager that rebuilds from the signed stable APT repository.

## Non-negotiable rules

- Support only the latest signed stable OpenAI Linux package on `amd64` and
  `arm64`. Remove obsolete drift paths in the same change.
- Trust `InRelease` through the pinned repository key, then verify `Packages`
  and package SHA-256 values. `latest` URLs are never a trust root.
- Never execute upstream maintainer scripts. Extract the data payload only.
- A clean build with no enabled ASAR feature must preserve `resources/app.asar`
  byte-for-byte.
- Keep the output identity `codex-desktop` under `/opt/codex-desktop`; do not
  install the upstream APT source, key, package identity, or maintainer scripts.
- Keep the user-facing desktop name **ChatGPT Community** and its distinct
  community icon; `ChatGPT` without the qualifier identifies the upstream app.
- The default core patch registry is empty. A core patch requires a reproduced
  launch/work blocker and a required regression test.
- Experimental or workflow-specific behavior belongs in `linux-features/` and
  remains disabled in committed configuration.
- Known retired feature IDs are ignored; arbitrary unknown IDs remain errors.
- Do not edit generated output (`codex-app/`, `dist/`, candidates, `target/`).

## Source routing

- Upstream verification/extraction: `scripts/lib/upstream-linux-package.js` and
  `scripts/lib/upstream-linux-package.sh`.
- Build orchestration: `install.sh`, `scripts/lib/*.sh`.
- Launcher: `launcher/start.sh.template`.
- Feature descriptors/resources/hooks: `linux-features/<id>/`.
- ASAR engine/reporting: `scripts/patches/`,
  `scripts/patch-linux-window-ui.js`, `scripts/lib/patch-report.js`.
- Packaging: `scripts/build-*.sh`, `scripts/lib/package-common.sh`,
  `packaging/`.
- Updater: `updater/src/`; minimal rebuild payload:
  `packaging/update-builder/`.
- Signed-release automation:
  `scripts/automation/upstream-linux-package-watchdog/`.
- Nix: `flake.nix`, `nix/upstream-linux-packages.json`, `nix/*.nix`.

Every repository feature and local feature must contain both `feature.json` and
`README.md`. Prefer declarative resources and runtime/package hooks over a
feature `stage.sh`.

## Editing guidance

- Search for all consumers before removing a descriptor, helper crate,
  package resource, workflow, or document.
- Treat exact minified filenames and symbols as drift-prone. Prefer semantic,
  unique anchors with fail-closed tests against the current official ASAR.
- Keep feature changes inside their feature directory unless a genuinely
  generic framework extension is required.
- Keep update-builder contents minimal and consumer-driven. Enabled feature
  resources and prebuilt helpers must be present; the full repository and
  Cargo workspaces must not be.
- Preserve user changes in dirty worktrees and never repair generated output by
  editing it in place.
- Update English and Chinese top-level usage when installation, removal,
  feature IDs, commands, or public identity changes.

## Runtime invariants

- The official `ChatGPT`, Electron libraries, native modules, `codex`, `rg`,
  code-mode host, locales, and Owl metadata come directly from upstream.
- The compact wrapper sets desktop identity, loads declarative feature hooks,
  and forwards arguments/URIs. Upstream owns single-instance, deep links, tray,
  windows, and lifecycle.
- The custom and official packages may coexist, but both use the upstream
  `Codex` user profile and must not be run concurrently.
- Legacy bundled Browser/Chrome cache migration must be narrow and
  fingerprinted: never wipe arbitrary plugin caches or user-authored plugins.
- AppImage never adds `--no-sandbox` automatically. Native packages adapt the
  upstream AppArmor policy to `/opt/codex-desktop/ChatGPT`.
- Candidate promotion is transactional. Build while running is allowed;
  promotion waits for exit. Rollback keeps the immediately previous artifact.

## Generated state

Generated/local paths include `codex-app/`, `codex-app-next/`,
`codex-app.backup-*`,
`.codex-app.candidate-*`, `dist/`, `dist-next/`, `target/`,
`linux-features/features.json`, `linux-features/local/`, updater state under
XDG config/state/cache, and launcher state under XDG state/cache.

## Commands and validation

```bash
./install.sh
./install.sh /path/to/chatgpt_<version>_<arch>.deb
make setup-native
make install-native
make deb
make rpm
make pacman
make appimage
```

`make setup-native` only configures optional features. `make install-native`
builds, packages, and installs for the current distribution.
`make bootstrap-native` installs build dependencies first and then performs the
same native installation. A local `UPSTREAM_DEB` is structural input, not a
replacement trust root for the signed repository.

Run the relevant subset, and use `./scripts/ci-local.sh all` for broad changes:

```bash
bash -n install.sh scripts/lib/*.sh launcher/start.sh.template
bash tests/scripts_smoke.sh
node --test scripts/lib/upstream-linux-package.test.js
node --test scripts/patch-linux-window-ui.test.js scripts/lib/linux-features.test.js linux-features/*/test.js
cargo test -p codex-update-manager
cargo clippy -p codex-update-manager --all-targets -- -D warnings
nix flake check
```

Package/update/launcher/framework changes are cross-format unless explicitly
scoped. When changing payloads, inspect all supported output formats. Refresh
Nix pins through `scripts/ci/update-official-linux-pins.sh`, never by inventing
hashes.

## Change expectations

- Source-security changes cover valid and invalid signatures, wrong keys,
  index/package hash failures, metadata mismatch, unsupported architecture, and
  incomplete payload.
- Feature changes run the adjacent test and an official-bundle build with that
  feature alone.
- Package payload changes inspect deb, RPM, pacman, AppImage, and Nix on the
  applicable architectures.
- Updater changes cover interrupted work, app-running guards, atomic promotion,
  rollback, cache cleanup, and persisted-state migration.
- Documentation changes verify relative links, documented Make/CLI commands,
  feature IDs, and `git diff --check`.
