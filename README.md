`codex-desktop` is an unofficial, community-maintained distribution of
OpenAI's official Linux ChatGPT desktop application. It verifies and
repackages the signed upstream Linux payload, adds disabled-by-default Linux
features, and produces deb, RPM, pacman, AppImage, and Nix outputs.

The custom application appears in desktop menus as **ChatGPT Community** and
uses an icon marked with a blue `C`. Its package, command, and installation
identity remain `codex-desktop` and `/opt/codex-desktop`, so it is easy to
distinguish from OpenAI's separate **ChatGPT** package.

OpenAI's signed Linux `.deb` is the only upstream source. The official
Electron runtime, native modules, bundled `codex` and `rg`, code-mode host,
plugins, libraries, locales, and Owl metadata are reused directly. With no
ASAR-changing feature enabled, `resources/app.asar` remains byte-for-byte
identical to the official package.

## Install

Clone the repository before building a native package or AppImage:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ilysenko/codex-desktop-linux.git
cd codex-desktop-linux
```

| Platform | Recommended command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Debian, Ubuntu, Pop!_OS, Mint, Elementary | `make bootstrap-native` | Builds and installs a `.deb` |
| Raspberry Pi 5, 64-bit OS | `make bootstrap-native` | Builds the official `arm64` payload; see [Pi notes](docs/raspberry-pi-5.md) |
| Fedora | `make bootstrap-native` | Builds and installs an RPM |
| openSUSE | `make bootstrap-native` | Builds and installs an RPM |
| Arch, Manjaro, EndeavourOS | `make bootstrap-native` | Builds and installs a pacman package |
| NixOS or another Nix system | `nix run github:ilysenko/codex-desktop-linux` | Builds and runs the flake output; see [Nix](docs/nix.md) |
| Atomic desktops or another distribution | `make build-app && make appimage` | Produces a local AppImage without the native updater |

The recommended native installation is:

```bash
make bootstrap-native
```

This installs build dependencies, resolves the current package through
OpenAI's signed stable APT metadata, builds `codex-app/`, creates the native
package for the detected distribution, and installs the newest artifact from
`dist/`.

If the dependencies are already installed, use:

```bash
make install-native
```

To choose optional features before installing:

```bash
make setup-native
make install-native
```

`make setup-native` only writes the local feature selection. It does not build
or install the application. See [Native setup](docs/native-setup.md) for the
guided flow, non-interactive settings, updater selection, and cleanup.

### Use an already downloaded official package

Normally the build resolves `amd64` or `arm64` from the signed stable index.
You can instead provide a local package that you already trust:

```bash
UPSTREAM_DEB=/path/to/chatgpt_<version>_<arch>.deb make build-app
```

The local package is still checked for package name, architecture, control
metadata, payload completeness, and SHA-256 recording. Because signed
repository discovery is skipped, the caller is responsible for its origin.
Old `.dmg`, `DMG=`, and `CODEX_DMG_*` inputs are intentionally unsupported.

### Before you install

- Only the latest signed stable OpenAI Linux package is supported, on `amd64`
  and `arm64`.
- Build tools require Node.js 20 or newer, npm, Python 3, curl, `gpgv`,
  `dpkg-deb`, tar, make, and a C/C++ toolchain. Rust is used for the updater and
  enabled native feature helpers. `make bootstrap-native` installs or guides
  you through these requirements.
- The official `chatgpt` and custom `codex-desktop` packages may coexist, but
  both intentionally use the upstream `Codex` user profile. Do not run them at
  the same time; the upstream single-instance lock may route the second launch
  into the process that is already running.
- AppImage never adds `--no-sandbox` automatically. If your distribution
  disables unprivileged user namespaces, use the native package or follow the
  sandbox guidance in [Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md).

### Anonymous daily usage count

To help the community decide whether maintaining this distribution is useful,
the launcher sends at most one anonymous usage event per UTC day to the
[public GoatCounter dashboard](https://gary.goatcounter.com/). The event
contains only the fixed path `/app-launch`. GoatCounter derives an aggregate
country from the network request; no application activity, account or machine
identifier, version, architecture, package format, language, screen size, or
referrer is sent. Every installation sends the same fixed, non-identifying
User-Agent so GoatCounter does not discard the request as a bot.

The request runs silently in the background. A missing `curl`, a blocked
request, or any other error never delays the application and produces no
output. Disable the usage count with the single environment variable:

```bash
CODEX_LINUX_DISABLE_USAGE_REPORTING=1 codex-desktop
```

## Uninstall

First close both **ChatGPT Community** and the official **ChatGPT** application.
Then remove the native package with the package manager that installed it:

```bash
# Debian / Ubuntu
sudo apt remove codex-desktop

# Fedora
sudo dnf remove codex-desktop

# openSUSE
sudo zypper remove codex-desktop

# Arch / Manjaro
sudo pacman -R codex-desktop
```

Native package removal disables the user update service. If a service from an
older or manual installation remains, remove it explicitly:

```bash
systemctl --user disable --now codex-update-manager.service
systemctl --user daemon-reload
```

For AppImage, delete the AppImage file you built. For a repository-only app,
delete only the generated tree inside the checkout:

```bash
rm -rf -- ./codex-app
```

For Nix, remove the package from your profile, Home Manager configuration, or
NixOS module and rebuild that profile or system.

Package removal preserves user data. To remove only Community wrapper and
updater state, inspect and then delete the following directories:

```text
~/.config/codex-desktop
~/.local/state/codex-desktop
~/.cache/codex-desktop
~/.config/codex-update-manager
~/.local/state/codex-update-manager
~/.cache/codex-update-manager
```

If `remote-mobile-control` was enabled, revoke paired devices before removing
its private device keys. Do not remove `~/.codex` unless you intentionally want
to delete the shared Codex profile, configuration, plugins, and project state
used by both official and Community applications.

Account rollouts and server-side ChatGPT features remain controlled by OpenAI.
Rebuilding this project does not unlock an account rollout.

## Configure optional features

The recommended editor is the setup wizard:

```bash
make setup-native
```

For manual configuration, copy the example to the gitignored local file:

```bash
cp linux-features/features.example.json linux-features/features.json
```

```json
{
  "enabled": [
    "read-aloud",
    "ui-tweaks"
  ]
}
```

Then rebuild and install:

```bash
make install-native
```

Private features may live under the gitignored
`linux-features/local/<feature-id>/` tree and use the same manifest contract.
Known retired IDs are ignored to migrate old local configs; arbitrary unknown
IDs and misspellings remain errors. See [the feature framework README](linux-features/README.md)
and [feature architecture](docs/linux-features-architecture.md).

## Updates

Native packages include `codex-update-manager` by default. Its user service
polls the same signed APT metadata, caches official packages by
version/architecture/SHA-256, reconstructs the selected native package with the
currently enabled features, and waits for the application to exit before
promotion. The immediately previous managed package remains available for
rollback.

```bash
codex-update-manager status
codex-update-manager status --json
codex-update-manager check-now
codex-update-manager diagnose
codex-update-manager install-ready
codex-update-manager rollback
```

```bash
systemctl --user enable --now codex-update-manager.service
systemctl --user status codex-update-manager.service
journalctl --user -u codex-update-manager.service
```

Build a manual-update package without the service:

```bash
PACKAGE_WITH_UPDATER=0 make package
make install
```

AppImage and repository-only generated apps do not include the native package
updater. Full behavior and recovery steps are documented in
[Updater](docs/updater.md).

## Build, package, and run

```bash
# Build the local application tree and run it without installing a package
make build-app
make run-app

# Build and install the package format detected for this distribution
make package
make install

# Build a specific output
make deb
make rpm
make pacman
make appimage
```

Builds are transactional: a candidate is verified before it replaces the
working tree. Enabled ASAR-feature drift rejects a candidate; disabled features
are not probed. Package scripts consume the generated `codex-app/` tree. See
[Build and packaging](docs/build-and-packaging.md) for prerequisites, variables,
output layout, parallelism, and payload inspection.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | First check |
|---|---|
| Official and Community launches interfere | Fully exit every `ChatGPT` process; both apps share the upstream profile |
| Browser/Chrome extension cannot connect after migration | Exit ChatGPT and Chrome completely, then follow the narrow cache repair in [Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md#browser-or-chrome-plugin-is-visible-but-cannot-connect) |
| Signature or package verification fails | Do not bypass it; check time, network, `gpgv`, architecture, and disk space |
| App does not launch | Run `/opt/codex-desktop/start.sh --diagnose` |
| App uses XWayland or needs persistent Electron flags | Put one flag per line in `~/.config/codex-desktop/electron-flags.conf`; for example, `--ozone-platform=wayland` |
| AppImage reports a sandbox error | Enable user namespaces or install a native package; `--no-sandbox` is not added automatically |
| Enabled feature drifts after an upstream release | Disable that feature to confirm the clean baseline and attach its patch report to an issue |
| Updater waits for application exit | Close official and Community processes, then inspect `codex-update-manager status --json` |
| Old `codex-app.backup-*` reports permission errors | Inspect the exact path and follow the root-owned backup procedure; never delete a wildcard blindly |
