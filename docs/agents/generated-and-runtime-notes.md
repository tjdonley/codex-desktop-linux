# Generated and runtime notes

Do not edit or commit generated application/package state:

- `codex-app/`, `codex-app-next/`, `codex-app.backup-*`,
  `.codex-app.candidate-*`
- `codex-*-app/`, `dist/`, `dist-next/`, `target/`
- `linux-features/features.json`, `linux-features/local/`
- staged feature manifests and build/patch reports
- updater config/state/cache/log directories under XDG paths

The local selection files are intentionally untracked:

```text
linux-features/features.json
linux-features/local/<id>/
```

Do not replace them with committed defaults or include private local feature
code in a pull request by accident.

The baseline staged tree is extracted from `/usr/lib/chatgpt` in the verified
official package. Its runtime, native modules, commands, libraries, locales, and
Owl metadata remain upstream-owned. `start.sh` and `.codex-linux/` are generated
from repository templates and feature manifests.

With no ASAR features, compare the staged and package `resources/app.asar`
SHA-256 values. Any difference is a build bug. With features, consult the patch
report and staged feature manifest.

Expected generated metadata under `codex-app/.codex-linux/` includes build-info
schema v2, the enabled feature snapshot, launcher hook directories, the
community icon, and patch/build reports where applicable. These are regenerated
from repository templates and manifests.

The official payload should continue to supply:

- `ChatGPT` and its Electron libraries;
- `resources/app.asar`;
- Linux native modules;
- bundled `codex`, `rg`, and code-mode host;
- bundled official plugins, locales, assets, and Owl metadata.

A generated tree containing a downloaded replacement Electron, an external CLI
bundle, rebuilt upstream native modules, or a local webview HTTP server signals
that retired architecture has been reintroduced.

Updater candidates are siblings of the active tree and are promoted atomically.
Do not manually rename an active/candidate pair or delete its recovery journal.
An old root-owned `codex-app.backup-*` is disposable only after verifying it is
not the active tree or the updater's recorded rollback artifact.

Package manager output under `/opt/codex-desktop` is installed state, not a
development source tree. Fix templates in the repository, rebuild a package,
and reinstall rather than modifying `/opt` in place.
