# Validation playbook

## Fast source checks

```bash
bash -n install.sh scripts/lib/*.sh launcher/start.sh.template
bash tests/scripts_smoke.sh
node --test scripts/lib/upstream-linux-package.test.js
node --test scripts/patch-linux-window-ui.test.js scripts/lib/linux-features.test.js linux-features/*/test.js
cargo test -p codex-update-manager
cargo clippy -p codex-update-manager --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

## Source-security matrix

Cover valid, corrupt, unsigned, and wrong-key `InRelease`; `Packages` digest
mismatch; package digest mismatch; wrong name/version/architecture; unsupported
architecture; and incomplete official payload. These are unit-tested with local
fixtures and fail closed.

## Baseline build

Build with `features.example.json`, inspect `.codex-linux/build-info.json`, and
compare the official and staged `resources/app.asar` hashes. Confirm no runtime
replacement, external CLI, or local content server appears in the staged tree.
Confirm the desktop name is **ChatGPT Community**, its icon has the community
mark, and the package/bin/path identity is still `codex-desktop`.

Smoke-test login, project open, terminal, file picker, URI launch, tray,
notifications, clean quit, and a second launch on GNOME Wayland, KDE Wayland,
and X11. Verify official/custom coexistence and shared-profile single-instance
behavior.

When upgrading an installation made by the former Linux port, also exercise the
recognized Browser/Chrome cache migration. Confirm the official clients use
`/tmp/codex-browser-use`, the Chrome app-server parent is not group-writable,
and unrelated/user-authored plugin caches are unchanged.

## Features

Build every retained feature independently and run its adjacent test. Enabled
drift must reject a candidate; disabled drift must not be probed. Retired IDs
are ignored and arbitrary unknown IDs fail.

## Package matrix

Inspect deb, RPM, pacman, AppImage, and Nix outputs on both architectures. Check
official ELF/runtime payload, dependencies, desktop identity, AppArmor path,
updater payload, and absence of official package-manager configuration.
AppImage must never inject `--no-sandbox`.

## Updater

Test new/unchanged releases, interrupted download, trust failures,
build-while-running, promotion-after-exit, rollback, cleanup, and state-schema
migration without losing installed/rollback artifacts.

## Broad validation

```bash
./scripts/ci-local.sh pr
./scripts/ci-local.sh all
nix flake check
nix build .#codex-desktop
```

Finish with a repository search for retired active architecture references and
a diff review for orphan helpers, tests, workflows, fixtures, and docs.
