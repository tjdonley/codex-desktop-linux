# Nix

The flake downloads the official architecture-specific Linux package pinned in
`nix/upstream-linux-packages.json`, verifies its hash through Nix, extracts the
ELF payload, and wraps it with the required Nix libraries.

These inputs are official Linux `.deb` files. Nix wraps the official runtime
directly instead of replacing Electron or rebuilding upstream native modules.
The derivation audits every ELF in that payload. Target-architecture glibc
executables and native modules receive the Nix dynamic linker and runtime
RUNPATH; foreign, musl, Android, and static payloads are classified and left
alone. Electron needs one additional fix: `patchelf` normally moves its
interpreter metadata beyond the first 2 KiB, where the bundled libc detector
can no longer see it. The derivation relocates that metadata into verified
`patchelf` padding so the detector selects glibc without using Electron's
unsafe report fallback. These checks run against both official architectures
and keep `resources/app.asar` byte-for-byte identical to upstream.

```bash
nix run github:ilysenko/codex-desktop-linux
nix build .#codex-desktop
```

Supported systems are `x86_64-linux` and `aarch64-linux`. The flake maps these
to upstream `amd64` and `arm64` packages. It does not replace Electron or build
upstream native modules.

## Flake outputs

The main package outputs are:

```text
codex-desktop
codex-desktop-computer-use-ui
codex-desktop-remote-mobile-control
codex-desktop-computer-use-ui-remote-mobile-control
```

The default app runs `codex-desktop`. Normal users should prefer the immutable
package output. `.#installer` is an audited source-staging tool for development
and packaging workflows; it is not a mutable updater for a Nix store package.

```bash
nix run github:ilysenko/codex-desktop-linux#codex-desktop
nix build .#codex-desktop-computer-use-ui
```

## Features

Use the NixOS or Home Manager module and pass explicit feature IDs. Defaults are
empty. Feature resources and required retained helper crates are staged by the
Nix derivation; helpers are release-built as Nix inputs, not during an update.

```nix
programs.codexDesktopLinux = {
  enable = true;
  linuxFeatures = [ "read-aloud" ];
};
```

Feature IDs are validated against `nix/linux-features.nix`. The two convenience
booleans remain available for existing configurations:

```nix
programs.codexDesktopLinux = {
  enable = true;
  computerUseUi.enable = true;
  remoteMobileControl.enable = false;
};
```

## Home Manager

Add the flake input and import its module:

```nix
{
  inputs.codex-desktop-linux.url =
    "github:ilysenko/codex-desktop-linux";

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, home-manager, codex-desktop-linux, ... }: {
    homeConfigurations.igor = home-manager.lib.homeManagerConfiguration {
      pkgs = nixpkgs.legacyPackages.x86_64-linux;
      modules = [
        codex-desktop-linux.homeManagerModules.default
        {
          programs.codexDesktopLinux = {
            enable = true;
            linuxFeatures = [ "read-aloud" "ui-tweaks" ];
          };
        }
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

## NixOS module

The NixOS module uses the same option namespace:

```nix
{
  imports = [ inputs.codex-desktop-linux.nixosModules.default ];

  programs.codexDesktopLinux = {
    enable = true;
    linuxFeatures = [ "codex-micro" ];
  };
}
```

The Nix package follows the standard `NIXOS_OZONE_WL` convention. When both
`NIXOS_OZONE_WL` and `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` are set, its wrapper starts Electron with
native Wayland rendering and text-input-v3 IME support.

On NixOS the launcher includes a package-local Bubblewrap adapter on `PATH` for
the Codex Linux command sandbox. The adapter preserves the sandbox policy and
adds the packaged `nix-ld` interpreter and runtime libraries inside that mount
namespace. Generic Linux Git, Node.js, Python, and pnpm runtimes downloaded into
the user cache therefore work in sandboxed workspace commands without enabling
the system-wide `programs.nix-ld` module. Other Nix systems keep the normal
launcher path and use their system Bubblewrap integration.

The adapter uses the generic loader symlink that NixOS provides through
`environment.stub-ld` by default. A system that explicitly disables both that
stub and `programs.nix-ld` keeps the packaged Bubblewrap integration, but its
generic cached runtimes remain unavailable.

The wrapper uses the NixOS OpenGL driver path when it is present and retains
Mesa as a fallback. Proprietary drivers on non-NixOS distributions may still
need that distribution's usual Nix/OpenGL integration; the flake deliberately
does not add a separate `nixGL` input or replace the host driver with Mesa.

When `codex-micro` is selected, the module also exposes its packaged udev
rules. Optional declarative remote-control service options live under
`programs.codexDesktopLinux.remoteControl` and are independent of the desktop
feature flag.

The official package's bundled `resources/codex` CLI is used by default. Set
`programs.codexDesktopLinux.cliPackage` only to select a different Nix CLI;
the module wraps both the command and desktop entry with a default
`CODEX_CLI_PATH`, while preserving an explicit value from the launch
environment.

When `remoteControl.enable` is set, both modules install a user service and
route Desktop requests to its Unix socket. The service gets a normal user or
system profile `PATH`; `remoteControl.environment` accepts strings, integers,
booleans, and null values (null entries are omitted). Secrets belong in
`remoteControl.environmentFile`, which must be an absolute canonical runtime
path outside `/nix/store` and may start with `-` for systemd's optional-file
semantics. The launcher daemon is suppressed by default to avoid creating a
second owner; set `remoteControl.disableLauncherAutostart = false` only when
that behavior is intentional.

## Development shell

Enter the flake development environment with:

```bash
nix develop
```

It provides the baseline source-verification tools. Rust helper development
still uses the repository Cargo workspaces. Before sending a Nix change, test
evaluation and the audited host-architecture runtime:

```bash
nix flake check
nix build .#checks.$(nix eval --impure --raw --expr builtins.currentSystem).nix-runtime
```

## Updating pins

Pins are updated from signed OpenAI APT metadata:

```bash
scripts/ci/update-official-linux-pins.sh
```

The automation checks both architectures. Do not hand-invent or bypass hashes.
The production pin workflow is dispatched by the standalone signed-package
watchdog only after the matching source revision has passed acceptance and any
required source repair has merged. It is not an independent timer: the
workflow binds its checkout, both package records, branch, pull request, and
explicit exact-head CI runs to one release campaign. The watchdog reviews and
merges that pull request only after the repository's required checks pass.

Validate changes with:

```bash
nix flake check
nix build .#checks.$(nix eval --impure --raw --expr builtins.currentSystem).nix-runtime
```

Nix outputs keep the **ChatGPT Community** desktop identity and shared upstream
`Codex` user profile. Do not run the Nix and official applications
concurrently.

Nix store packages do not use the mutable native-package updater. Update the
flake input or lock file and rebuild through your normal Nix/Home Manager/NixOS
workflow, for example:

```bash
nix flake update codex-desktop-linux
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#your-host
# or: home-manager switch --flake .#your-user
```

An unlocked `nix run github:ilysenko/codex-desktop-linux` follows the current
repository revision. A configuration with a lock file continues to use its
pinned revision until that input is updated.
