# Troubleshooting

## Source verification fails

Run the verifier test suite and inspect the generated metadata:

```bash
node --test scripts/lib/upstream-linux-package.test.js
./install.sh --inspect --report-dir /tmp/codex-inspect
```

Do not bypass a signature or hash failure. Confirm system time, HTTPS access to
`persistent.oaistatic.com`, `gpgv`, the pinned key fingerprint, and sufficient
disk space. An explicit package must match host architecture and be named
`chatgpt` in control metadata.

## The app does not launch

```bash
/opt/codex-desktop/start.sh --diagnose
/opt/codex-desktop/ChatGPT --version
journalctl --user -u codex-update-manager.service --no-pager
```

The diagnostic checks the official executable, ASAR, bundled `codex`, `rg`, and
code-mode host. It also warns when Chromium sandbox prerequisites are missing.

Also confirm that the installed package architecture matches the machine and
that no official ChatGPT process is already holding the shared profile lock:

```bash
uname -m
pgrep -a -f '(/ChatGPT|/chatgpt)' || true
```

Do not start the underlying `ChatGPT` binary directly for normal use. The
`codex-desktop` wrapper supplies the correct desktop identity and enabled
feature hooks.

## Persistent Electron flags and native Wayland

The launcher reads shared Electron flags from
`${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/electron-flags.conf` and Community-specific
flags from
`${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/codex-desktop/electron-flags.conf`, in that
order. Put one complete argument on each line; blank lines and lines beginning
with `#` are ignored. App-specific flags are followed by enabled feature flags
and explicit command-line arguments, so a later explicit argument can override
an earlier setting.

To force native Wayland rendering without editing a generated desktop entry:

```bash
mkdir -p "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/codex-desktop"
printf '%s\n' '--ozone-platform=wayland' > \
  "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/codex-desktop/electron-flags.conf"
```

Restart every running official and Community process after changing the file.
The launcher does not evaluate shell quoting or split a line into multiple
arguments.

## Chromium sandbox or AppArmor

Prefer a native package, which installs an AppArmor profile adapted to
`/opt/codex-desktop/ChatGPT`. AppImage intentionally refuses to disable the
sandbox automatically. Enable unprivileged user namespaces according to your
distribution policy or use the native package.

If a native package was copied between systems, verify its adapted profile and
reload AppArmor according to the distribution's tooling. Never solve a
packaging error by globally disabling Chromium sandboxing.

## Duplicate or stale desktop entries

The official package should appear as **ChatGPT**. This project should appear
as **ChatGPT Community** with a blue `C` mark. Confirm the selected entry:

```bash
grep -H '^Name=' \
  /usr/share/applications/chatgpt.desktop \
  /usr/share/applications/codex-desktop.desktop 2>/dev/null || true
```

After upgrading from an older package, refresh the desktop database or log out
and in if your shell keeps stale names or icons. Do not rename the official
desktop file to work around a shell cache.

## Official and custom apps interfere

Both use the upstream `Codex` profile. Fully exit the official `chatgpt` process
before starting `codex-desktop`, and vice versa. Their packages and desktop
entries can coexist, but upstream single-instance locking prevents reliable
parallel sessions.

In the desktop menu, the custom build is **ChatGPT Community** with a blue `C`;
the unqualified **ChatGPT** entry is OpenAI's package.

## Browser or Chrome plugin is visible but cannot connect

The first Community launch after migrating from the legacy pre-official build
refreshes cached Browser and Chrome plugins only when their bundled manifests
match the official Linux plugins and they contain a known retired Linux-port
marker. This one-time migration replaces the old custom Chrome extension host
and fixes the old `/tmp/codex-browser-use-<uid>` discovery path; the official
Linux runtime uses `/tmp/codex-browser-use`. It also removes legacy group-write
permission from the private `.plugin-appserver` runtime directory, which the
Chrome host rejects as an untrusted parent path.

If Browser was already loaded before that migration ran, fully exit every
ChatGPT process, fully exit Chrome/Chromium, start **ChatGPT Community**, and
then reopen the browser. Arbitrary plugin caches and user-authored plugins are
never rewritten.

Clearing the entire browser profile or all Codex plugin caches is not a normal
repair step. The official Browser/Chrome integration is already present in the
Linux payload; this migration only replaces known snapshots created by the old
community port.

If the legacy snapshot predates the recognized migration markers, remove only
the two re-creatable upstream-bundled caches, then restart Community followed
by Chrome:

```bash
pkill -TERM -x ChatGPT 2>/dev/null || true
rm -rf -- \
  "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/plugins/cache/openai-bundled/browser" \
  "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/plugins/cache/openai-bundled/chrome"
chmod go-w "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/plugins/.plugin-appserver" 2>/dev/null || true
```

Do not delete the whole `plugins` directory: it may contain user plugins and
unrelated cached integrations.

## A feature build fails after an upstream release

Disable the feature in `linux-features/features.json` and rebuild to confirm the
official baseline. Enabled feature drift deliberately blocks candidate
promotion. Report the feature ID, package version/architecture, and patch report.

Known retired feature IDs are ignored. A misspelled or arbitrary unknown ID is
an error; correct the config rather than adding a compatibility alias.

## Updater is waiting

```bash
codex-update-manager status
systemctl --user status codex-update-manager.service
```

`WaitingForAppExit` is expected: close all ChatGPT/Codex desktop processes. For
a failed privileged install, run `codex-update-manager install-ready` after
fixing the reported package-manager issue. Roll back with
`codex-update-manager rollback`.

Collect a useful updater report with:

```bash
codex-update-manager diagnose --json
journalctl --user -u codex-update-manager.service -n 200 --no-pager
```

## Native package build or install fails

Start by separating staging from packaging:

```bash
make build-app
make package
```

If staging passes but packaging fails, confirm the distribution builder is
installed and inspect the final lines for the selected deb/RPM/pacman command.
If `sudo`-created files from an old checkout block cleanup, use the exact backup
procedure below; do not rerun the whole build as root.

For constrained systems, limit parallel compilation and compression:

```bash
MAX_BUILD_THREADS=2 make install-native
```

## Clean rebuild

Generated state may be removed and rebuilt:

```bash
make clean-dist
make build-app
make package
```

Do not delete the updater rollback artifact unless you intentionally give up
the recovery path.

To remove only package artifacts, use `make clean-dist`. `make clean-state` is
more destructive: it removes updater config/state/cache and therefore its
managed rollback information.

## Old app backup cannot be removed

`codex-app.backup-*` directories are generated transactional backups, not
source files or additional installed applications. A backup created by an old
root-run build may be owned by root. Current builds collapse that cleanup
failure to one warning and continue with the accepted candidate.

Inspect the exact stale directories before changing or deleting anything:

```bash
find "$PWD" -maxdepth 1 -type d -name 'codex-app.backup-*' -print
```

For a confirmed stale path, replace `/absolute/path/to/backup` below with one
exact path printed above:

```bash
sudo chown -R -- "$(id -u):$(id -g)" /absolute/path/to/backup
rm -rf -- /absolute/path/to/backup
```

Never run the cleanup against the repository root, `codex-app/`, the active
updater rollback artifact, `$HOME`, or a wildcard you have not inspected.
